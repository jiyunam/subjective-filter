the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 	1
the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting . 	1
laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 	1
on balance , i recommend the movie both for nicholson's performance and for the opportunity to spend some time with the kind of man that we often meet in real life , but rarely see on screen . 	1

this is riveting stuff , especially in its account of how refugee culture and community spring up almost overnight . 	1
the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 	1
the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale . 	1
it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 	1
there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes . 	1
it's gripping entertainment in a popular vein -- the police procedural -- that nevertheless follows no preconceived formulas . 	1
jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 	1

a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 	1
this lively klasky csupo production is a convincing amplification of the popular nickelodeon series . 	1
with dickens' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told . 	1
that a high-profile movie with big-name actors could inspire such philosophical reflection is impressive . 	1
culkin , who's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield . 	1
peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery	1

like the best of godard's movies . . . it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable . 	1
by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 	1
the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care . 	1
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 	1
it's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock , garry shandling and colin quinn . 	1
the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 	1
a pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro . 	1
