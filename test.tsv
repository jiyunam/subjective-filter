[t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 	1
its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 	1

reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes . 	1

a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 	1
[koshashvili] sometimes drags [the ideas] out ( the film needs tightening ) , but they're worth considering all the same . 	1

you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down . 	1
like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever . 	1
constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act . 	1

not a bad way to spend a couple of hours . 	1
a witty coming-of-middle-age comedy with hilarious performances by first-time director tony shalhoub and wife brooke adams . 	1

harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . 	1
scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 	1

a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 	1
audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 	1
just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 	1
even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm . 	1
�an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle . 	1
the film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen . 	1
 with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . 	1
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 	1
rarely , a movie is more than a movie . go . 	1

the new guy does have a heart . now , if it only had a brain . 	1
in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . 	1
it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 	1
without resorting to camp or parody , haynes ( like sirk , but differently ) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange . 	1
this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 	1
even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 	1
the movie is never less than watchable and consistently entertaining , but the need to push gags too far keeps tripping it up . 	1
it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another . 	1
enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid . 	1
should be seen and absorbed , if only to recall that hollywood horror does , occasionally , get it more or less right . 	1
for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece . 	1
anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 	1
i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . 	1
the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael . 	1

romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here . 	1
ver wiel has concocted one of the most elaborately twisted , diverting caper films in years . 	1
lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child's interest and an adult's patience . but it also has many of the things that made the first one charming . 	1
carefully crafted , notably in its deft dramatic structuring , and has become timely in a way its maker could never have anticipated . 	1
grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length	1

this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked . 	1
i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 	1
it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 	1
despite these annoyances , the capable clayburgh and tambor really do a great job of anchoring the characters in the emotional realities of middle age . 	1
the off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery . 	1
the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 	1
it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 	1

swimming isn't a major film . nor does it try to be . but what , in the end , is a major film ? if it's one that accomplishes what it sets out to do , then we ought to correct ourselves . 	1

too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 	1
k-19 : the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining . 	1
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 	1
the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 	1

the funny thing is , i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit . 	1
the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 	1
a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 	1

casting its gaze on painting masterworks and thousands of jewel-encrusted , elaborately costumed extras , russian ark is like nothing you've ever seen . 	1
the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 	1
[seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 	1
in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters � damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 	1
it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 	1
the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 	1
credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic . 	1
while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 	1
just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation . 	1

like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 	1
vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 	1
77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 	1
with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 	1
sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 	1

brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 	1

a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness . 	1
an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 	1
despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 	1
there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit . 	1
the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 	1
from the trembling fury of gheorgiu's tosca to the penetrating stare of raimondi's scarpia , this tosca blazes with passion . at its best , it's sublime . 	1

proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they can't go wrong . better effects , better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh . an excellent sequel . 	1
the most impressive quality of this charming movie is the way the characters , who are all recognizable 'types , ' refuse to behave the way we expect . 	1
swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 	1
if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like , say , treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i'll take the latter every time . 	1
director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth . 	1
the rookie feels like baseball itself : sort of boring , sort of stately , yet possessed of an ineffable poetry that speaks to the young heart of old men and their sons . 	1
professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 	1
coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema . 	1
there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 	1
waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself . 	1
clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 	1
essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality	1
it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia . 	1
despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 	1
scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 	1
although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 	1
lejos del para�so es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y o�dos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios . 	1
vera has created a provocative , absorbing drama that reveals the curse of a self-hatred instilled by rigid social mores . 	1
rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 	1
the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 	1
upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 	1
highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results . 	1
it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 	1
the film is rich with colorful characters and enlivened by its strong , convincing picture of rural trinidad . 	1

here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 	1
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 	1
one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece . 	1
this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 	1
plays like a toddler running along a lumpy field , stumbling every few feet but always getting back up and eventually reaching his destination , unharmed and happy . 	1
it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness . 	1
the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 	1
a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 	1
it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 	1
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 	1
the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot . 	1
the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum's good intentions . 	1
manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . 	1
this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 	1
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 	1
there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 	1
[nesbitt's is] one of those performances that simply 'is . '	1
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 	1
the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 	1
at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 	1
shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 	1
sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 	1
the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie weren't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is . 	1
like a veteran head cutter , barbershop is tuned in to its community . 	1
this slight slice of l . a . life is distinguished by two fine , subtle performances . 	1
strong stuff , minus the upbeat sentimentality of last year's oscar-winner . in that respect , it may be an even more important film . 	1

 . . . the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see . 	1
ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 	1

by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so . 	1
at its heart and most importantly , spirited away concerns a little girl learning to honour her friends and her family by valuing herself . 	1

the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 	1
in this age of soulless , fx-driven action franchises raimi anachronistically emphasizes character development . 	1

where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 	1
the threat implied in the title pok�mon 4ever is terrifying � like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 	1

a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 	1
confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk . 	1
although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 	1

like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film . 	1
an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 	1
 . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . . 	1
extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it . 	1

if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 	1
jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used . 	1
has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . 	1
this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . 	1
lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . 	1
the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 	1
more than the last time around , it has elements that might help divert those bigger people who find themselves unavoidably in attendance . 	1
punch-drunk love mostly feints and jabs ; by anderson's standards it's strictly lightweight . but sandler delivers the kind of knockout performance that even his staunchest defenders probably didn't realize he had in him . 	1
a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over . 	1
the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 	1
